# Adaptive_Point_Cloud_Clustering
Here is the implementation of point cloud clustering for Livox HAP Lidar for object detection. This package can be run with VLP or Livox Lidar with different parameter setting. 

## How to build ##
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone git@github.com:Xiushishen/Adaptive_Point_Cloud_Clustering.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

## Citation ##
